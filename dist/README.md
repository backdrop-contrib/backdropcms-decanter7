# Compiled output directory

This directoy will contain the compiled output from the theme build process. Do not edit any of these files manually

Run `yarn watch` or `yarn build` to populate this directory.

## Commiting changes

The files in this directory should be tracked using git. This allows the theme to be used without an aditional build step by the site builder.
